- 👋 Hi, I’m @koraCoder
- 👀 and I study [cognition and identity](www.markkoranda.com)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how people learn through using words, and how things were invented during the industrial revolution.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any UX-design problem that aims to close the equity gaps in everyday behavior. For example, a tracker that helps optimize decisions for 
"when I move, should I buy a washer or commute to the nearest laundromat?" 
- 📫 Reach me at korandamark at gee mail dot com.
